##  	Workshop on Data -Driven Modelling 2017

8th of January to 9th of January 2018

Centre for Excellence in Computational Engineering and Networking ([CEN](https://www.amrita.edu/center/computational-engineering-and-networking)),

Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham ([Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu/)).

### About Data -Driven Modelling 2017
Data-driven dynamical systems is a burgeoning field-it connects how measurements of nonlinear dynamical systems and/or complex systems can be used with well-established methods in dynamical system theory. This is a critically important new direction because the governing equations of many problems under consideration by practitioners in various scientific fields are not typically known. Thus, using data alone to help derive, in an optimal sense, the best dynamical system representation of a given application allows for important new insights. The recently developed dynamic mode decomposition ([DMD](http://bookstore.siam.org/ot149/)) is an innovative tool for integrating data with dynamical systems theory. The DMD has deep connections with traditional dynamical systems theory and many recent innovations in compressed sensing and machine learning. 

The primary target audience of the workshop is MTech/M.Sc students, research scholars and faculty. We hope to have an interactive session, with a free exchange of ideas, views and comments.
